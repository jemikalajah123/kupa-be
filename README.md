# Record Store API SOLUTIONâœ…


# Enhancing Search Performance & Scalability  

## âœ… Optimized Solution:  
- **MongoDB Query Filters:** Directly applied query filters in the `find()` method to optimize data retrieval.  
- **Indexing:** Added indexes on `artist`, `album`, `category`, and `format` to speed up searches.  
- **Pagination:** Implemented `limit` and `skip` to efficiently handle large datasets, reducing unnecessary memory consumption.

# Fetching Tracklist Data from MusicBrainz API  
## âœ… Optimized Solution:  
- Implemented automatic tracklist fetching when a record is created or updated with an `mbid`.  
- Stored the retrieved tracklist in the record model for future reference.  
- Enforced uniqueness checks during record creation and updates to maintain data integrity.  

## âœ… Benefits:  
- Reduces manual data entry.  
- Ensures tracklist accuracy and consistency.

# Order System Implementation  

## ðŸ”¹ Requirements Addressed:  
To streamline order management, I implemented:  
- Order placement functionality.  
- Stock validation before processing orders.  
- Automatic stock deduction upon successful order completion.  

## âœ… Benefits:  
- Prevents overselling by ensuring stock availability.  
- Keeps inventory updated in real time.  
- Provides APIs to fetch all orders and retrieve single order details.

# Implementing Caching for Faster Queries  

## ðŸ”¹ Caching Strategy:  
To improve query performance and reduce database load, I integrated **Redis caching** with a **cache-first approach**:  

- **Application-Level Caching:** Frequently accessed records are cached in Redis.  
- **Query Caching Workflow:**  
  1. Check Redis before querying MongoDB.  
  2. If data is found in cache, return it immediately.  
  3. If not found, fetch from MongoDB, store in Redis, and return the result.  

## âœ… Benefits:  
- Reduces database query load.  
- Improves response times for frequently accessed data.  
- Enhances system scalability by leveraging caching mechanisms.

# Project Setup for Scalability & Maintainability  
## âœ… Project Setup:  

### 1. **Modularization:**  
- **Third-Party Module:** Handles all external service integrations (e.g., MusicBrainz API, Redis).  
- **Order Module:** Contains order-related controllers, services, and DTOs.  
- **Shared Module:** Includes reusable utilities like HTTP interceptors, response formatters, and validation helpers.  

### 2. **Controller Cleanup:**  
- Moved logic into a dedicated **Service**, keeping controllers clean.  
- Separated order-related logic into **OrderService** to ensure single responsibility.  

### 3. **Introduced DTOs (Data Transfer Objects):**  
- Standardized data structures for request and response payloads.  
- Improved validation and type safety, reducing the risk of invalid data processing.  

### 4. **Created Root Index Files:**  
- Each module now has an `index.ts` file to aggregate exports.  
- Simplifies imports and keeps the codebase clean.  

## âœ… Benefits of the New Structure:  
- **Improved Code Readability & Maintainability:** Clear separation of concerns makes it easier to manage and extend the application.  
- **Better Scalability:** The modular approach allows new features to be added without disrupting existing functionality.  
- **Easier Testing:** Services and controllers are now independent, making unit testing more straightforward.  
- **Clean & Organized Imports:** The use of root `index.ts` files reduces import clutter and improves maintainability.

## ðŸ”¹ Dockerization & CI/CD Pipeline
To further streamline deployment and improve development efficiency, I introduced:

### Dockerization:

- Created a Dockerfile for local development and a Dockerfile.prod for optimized production builds.
- This ensures a consistent environment across all deployments.

### CI/CD Pipeline:
Automated pipeline script to:
- Run tests (unit & e2e) before deployment when a test DB is connected for the pipeline.
- Build the Docker image.
- Deploy the service to production automatically.
- This ensures code quality and smooth deployments.

# Summary  
 
âœ… Faster search queries with MongoDB optimizations.  
âœ… Automatic tracklist fetching for better data accuracy.  
âœ… Efficient order management with stock validation.  
âœ… Improved response times with Redis caching.  
âœ… Clean, modular project structure for long-term maintainability. 
âœ… 100% Test coverage that is incorporated to run in the pipeline before deployment.   

These changes enhance system efficiency and make it easier to scale and maintain over time. ðŸš€

# Installation

### Install dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
````

### Docker for MongoDB Emulator
To use the MongoDB Emulator, you can start it using Docker:
```
npm run mongo:start
```
This will start a MongoDB instance running on your local machine. You can customize the settings in the Docker setup by modifying the docker-compose-mongo.yml if necessary. In the current configuration, you will have a MongoDB container running, which is accessible at localhost:27017.
This mongo url will be necessary on the .env file, with example as follows:

```
MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/records
```
This will point your application to a local MongoDB instance.

### MongoDB Data Setup
The data.json file contains example records to seed your database. The setup script will import the records from this file into MongoDB.

To set up the database with the example records:

```
npm run setup:db
```
This will prompt the user to cleanup (Y/N) existing collection before importing data.json


#### data.json Example
Hereâ€™s an example of the data.json file that contains records:
```
[
    {
        "artist": "Foo Fighters",
        "album": "Foo Fighers",
        "price": 8,
        "qty": 10,
        "format": "CD",
        "category": "Rock",
        "mbid": "d6591261-daaa-4bb2-81b6-544e499da727"
  },
  {
        "artist": "The Cure",
        "album": "Disintegration",
        "price": 23,
        "qty": 1,
        "format": "Vinyl",
        "category": "Alternative",
        "mbid": "11af85e2-c272-4c59-a902-47f75141dc97"
  },
]
```

### Running the App

```
npm run test:e2e
```
Run Tests with Coverage


Run Linting
To check if your code passes ESLint checks:
